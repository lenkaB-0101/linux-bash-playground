# 🐧 Linux Bash Playground

**Practical Bash scripts for everyday system operations and diagnostics**

This repository showcases my hands-on experience with Linux, Bash scripting,
and operational thinking gained from working in real-world, often legacy and
integration-heavy environments.

## 📌 About this project

This project is a collection of **simple Bash scripts** created while learning
and solving common operational tasks in Linux systems.

The goal is **not** large-scale automation or enterprise tooling, but rather to
demonstrate:
- operational mindset
- understanding of system behavior
- ability to react quickly in real production situations

The scripts reflect scenarios typical for legacy or constrained environments,
where modern tooling is limited or unavailable.
